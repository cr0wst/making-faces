## Face Example

To run the face example you will need to supply your own training and test set. Put these images in the training_set and test_set folder.

For training and test set images, I recommend the Yale Face Database: http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database

Then use the following command in R to source the file and run:

```r
source('path-to-Face Example.R', chdir = TRUE)
```
